            of pipenv in favor of the new requirements command. For more info see
            https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/advanced/#generating-a-requirements-txt
            NOTE: the requirements command parses Pipfile.lock directly without performing any
            locking operations. Updating packages should be done by running pipenv lock
            
#
# These requirements were autogenerated by pipenv
# To regenerate from the project's Pipfile, run:
#
#    pipenv lock --requirements
